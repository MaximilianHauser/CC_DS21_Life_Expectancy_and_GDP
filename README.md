## Codecademy Portfolio Project: Life expectancy and GDP

![Tower of Babel, displaying architecture through the ages](babel_architecture_through_ages.png)  

Descriptive analysis performed on data from 
[World Bank, World Development Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators) 
with the goal of identifying the relationship between Life Expectancy, GDP and 
GDP per capita (the later 2 converted to 2017 international dollars using 
purchasing power parity rates.)  

The most common numerical measures of frequency, central tendency, dispersion 
and position were derived from the data. In addition, correlation was derived 
from the data as a bivariate measure. These were supported by visualization 
through boxplots, correlation matrix and scatterplots.
